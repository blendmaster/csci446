I am the bone of my console   
Rails is my body, Ruby is my blood   
I have created over a thousand lines of code   
Unknown to life, nor known to death   
Have withstood pain to create many migrations   
Yet these hands will never deploy anything   
So as I pray, Unlimited Webapp Works!

projects. Pretend that I'm cool and stuff.
